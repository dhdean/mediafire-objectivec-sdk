Leverage the MediaFire Platform to connect with millions of MediaFire users around the world and add powerful features to your iOS or Mac OSX app.

Full documentation available here: [MediaFire Developers](https://www.mediafire.com/developers/sdks_and_tools/objective_c/index.php)

## Adding to your project

1. Get the latest source from GitHub by either [downloading as a zip file](https://github.com/MediaFire/mediafire-objectivec-sdk/archive/master.zip) or by cloning the repository at `https://github.com/MediaFire/mediafire-objectivec-sdk.git`.
2. Create a new Xcode project or open an existing project.
3. Drag the MediaFireSDK Xcode Project file `MediaFireSDK.xcodeproj` into your Xcode Project Navigator. Or add it using File > Add Files to 'Your Project'.
4. Add `MediaFireSDK` under "Target Dependencies" in your Target's "Build Phases".
5. Add `libMediaFireSDK.a` under "Link Binary With Libraries" in your Target's "Build Phases".
6. Add "Other Link Flag" `-all_load` under "Linking" in your Target's "Build Settings".
7. Import `MediaFireSDK.h` in `AppDelegate.m`

  ```obj-c
  #import "MediaFireSDK/MediaFireSDK.h"
  ```

8. Add the following configuration code to your `AppDelegate.m` within `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` or `applicationDidFinishLaunching`

  ```obj-c
  [MediaFireSDK createWithConfig:@{@"app_id" : @"<your app id>", @"api_key" : @"<your api key>"}];
  ```

9. Add the following log capture function to `AppDelegate.m`:

  ```obj-c
  extern void MFCaptureLogMessage(NSString* message) {
      // Use this method to capture log messages from MediaFire SDK.
  }
  ```

Build and run project. If errors occur, clean build folder (⌥⇧⌘K) and try again. 

## Demo Projects

Two demo projects are included for example usage.

### iOS Demo
In `AppDelegate.m`, replace `<your app id>` with your app id. And replace `<your api key>` with your generated api key or a blank
string if "Require Secret Key" is disabled in your developer profile. Visit https://www.mediafire.com/developers for more information. 

### OSX Demo
In `AppDelegate.m`, replace `<your app id>` with your app id. And replace `<your api key>` with your generated api key or a blank
string if "Require Secret Key" is disabled in your developer profile. Visit https://www.mediafire.com/developers for more information. 

In the MediafireSDK Project under "Build Settings" change "Base SDK" to `OS X 10.9` or later.

## Usage

Developed for use with iOS 7.0+ and OSX 10.9+
